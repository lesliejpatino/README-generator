## Description 
* This is a README generator that will allow the user to quickly create a professional README through the command line.


## Link
* Link to my GitHub repo for the [README Generator](https://github.com/lesliejpatino/README-generator)


## Installation 
The following dependencies will be needed in order for this application to work:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Node module - Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
* [Node module - FS(file system) ](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)

All of the work will be done on a [Javacript](https://www.javascript.com/) file.


## Usage
Once the dependencies mentioned under [Installation](#installation) are installed, the application can be run directly from the command line by typing:
* node index.js

The user will then be presented with prompts and their answers will populate the README.
